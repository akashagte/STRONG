# STRONG
Developed a Path Tracking System for the Annual Maker Space Championship. Acronym STRONG stands for "STability Relief for the Optically challeNGed"

1. Analysed field movements of visually impaired patients to identify activity patterns.
2. Designed environment sensing, path tracking and signalling algorithm on Arduino IDE with C++.
3. Field tested the device on different terrains and scenarios to achieve an error rate of under 10%
