# STRONG
Developed this Path Tracking System as our Final Year Project. Acronym STRONG stands for "STability Relief for the Optically challeNGed"

• Analysed field movements of visually impaired patients to identify activity patterns.
• Designed environment sensing, path tracking and signalling algorithm on Arduino IDE with C++.
• Field tested the device on different terrains and scenarios to achieve an error rate of under 10%
